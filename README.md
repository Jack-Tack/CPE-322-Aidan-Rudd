# CPE-322-Aidan-Rudd
My goal is twofold in this class. One part of my goal is to further my knowledge of GitHub throughout this class. The second part of my goal is to become much more creative as I have a hard time coming up with ideas on my own.
# Lab 1 Notes + Observations
Initially tried to use Windows Command Prompt but quickly realized that the cp command did not exist, switched over to Windows PowerShell.
After this, I found out through research online that the instructions to edit the path variables were incorrect and I needed to send the path to the bin of ghdl and gtkwave.
I managed to get many of the tests working.

# Lab 2 Notes + Observations
I managed to get most of the commands to work and found a replacement for the nano command for Windows Powershell. After installing chocolatey and nano as well as editing paths, the nano command would not work so I had to use Notepad to create the file. I was also able to find a replacement for the ifconfig command for Windows as well as the uname command and df.

# Lab 3 Notes + Observations
This lab was much easier for me to get working than the last two. Installing Python on Windows Powershell was as simple as downloading from the Microsoft Store. I also was able to install jdcal, astral, and geopy using pip3. Down below is the screenshot showing off various examples from the iot repository.
