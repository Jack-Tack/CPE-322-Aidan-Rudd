# CPE-322-Aidan-Rudd
My goal is twofold in this class. One part of my goal is to further my knowledge of GitHub throughout this class. The second part of my goal is to become much more creative as I have a hard time coming up with ideas on my own.
# Lab 1 Notes + Observations
Initially tried to use Windows Command Prompt but quickly realized that the cp command did not exist, switched over to Windows PowerShell.
After this, I found out through research online that the instructions to edit the path variables were incorrect and I needed to send the path to the bin of ghdl and gtkwave.
I managed to get many of the tests working.
