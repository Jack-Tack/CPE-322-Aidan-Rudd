# CPE-322-Aidan-Rudd
My goal is twofold in this class. One part of my goal is to further my knowledge of GitHub throughout this class. The second part of my goal is to become much more creative as I have a hard time coming up with ideas on my own.
# Lab 1 Notes + Observations
Initially tried to use Windows Command Prompt but quickly realized that the cp command did not exist, switched over to Windows PowerShell.
After this, I found out through research online that the instructions to edit the path variables were incorrect and I needed to send the path to the bin of ghdl and gtkwave.
I managed to get many of the tests working.

# Lab 2 Notes + Observations
I managed to get most of the commands to work and found a replacement for the nano command for Windows Powershell. After installing chocolatey and nano as well as editing paths, the nano command would not work so I had to use Notepad to create the file. I was also able to find a replacement for the ifconfig command for Windows as well as the uname command and df.

# Lab 3 Notes + Observations
This lab was much easier for me to get working than the last two. Installing Python on Windows Powershell was as simple as downloading from the Microsoft Store. I also was able to install jdcal, astral, and geopy using pip3. Down below is the screenshot showing off various examples from the iot repository.

# Lab 4 Notes + Observations
This was the most difficult lab for me as I had to completely reintstall everything to WSL and Ubuntu. Using these made the assignment far easier and I was able to get it done with relative ease compared to before. Down below is my working map and a screenshot of the Ubuntu command line open.

# Lab 5 Notes + Observations
This lab was quite simple as I am now using Ubuntu so I do not need to manually adjust environment variables. I have managed to get the two terminals running with CPU usage present within them. Down below is my screenshot showing both of the terminals and the subcpu.py and pubcpu.py commands working on them.

# Lab 6 Notes + Observations
This was the easiest lab for me as it only took around five minutes to complete. I was able to see the output of hello-world and the other programs and I obtained the desired result from using say_hello.py. Down below are the results of this week's lab.

# Lab 7 Notes + Observations
This was the hardest lab so far for me as I needed to combine both Powershell and Ubuntu in order to complete both portions of the lab. I achieved the desired results however, so I believe that my hard work and searching the internet paid off in the end.

# Lab 8 Notes + Observations
This lab was rather easy to complete as all I needed to do was add in a few charts to my google sheet from the previous week and edit a few files using the nano function.

# Lab 9 Notes + Observations
This was a rather easy lab to complete as I just needed to install a few packages in Ubuntu. I generated the pinta and gimp pngs that were required of me. The results are shown below.

# Lab 10 Notes + Observations
The last lab was also not that difficult, I had to reinstall a few things since I was using my Ubuntu but other than that there was no issues with the lab. All of my results are shown below.
